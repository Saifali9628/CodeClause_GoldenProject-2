# Speed Typing Test in Python

This Python project is a Speed Typing Test application that measures your typing speed by randomly selecting sentences and calculating the words per minute (WPM) you type within a specific time limit.

## Introduction

Hello, I'm Saif Ali, the creator of this Python Speed Typing Test application. The purpose of this application is to provide a fun way for users to enhance their typing skills and improve their typing speed as part of the CodeClause Golden Project.

## Code Overview

The project is built using Python and the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface. Below is a brief overview of the code structure:

- **Importing Libraries**: The code starts by importing the necessary modules such as `tkinter` for GUI elements and `ctypes` for setting the process DPI awareness.

- **Class Definition - TypingSpeedTest**: This class defines the structure of the typing speed test application, including the setup of the GUI, handling labels, and managing the typing test process.

- **Random Text Selection**: The application randomly selects a piece of text for the typing test from a predefined list.

- **UI Setup**: The graphical user interface (GUI) is set up, including labels for displaying the text, tracking time, and handling key presses.

- **Typing Test Logic**: The logic for the typing test is implemented, allowing users to type the displayed text and measuring their typing speed.

- **Time Tracking**: The application tracks the time elapsed during the typing test.
